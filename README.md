# Emotion-Recognition-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for emotion recognition using a facial image dataset.

## Steps

### 1. Dataset Extraction

Download the emotion dataset and extract images from the provided zip file (`emotion.zip`).

### 2. Dataset Exploration

Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of images across different emotion labels.

### 3. Data Loading and Preprocessing

Load, resize, and normalize images for training the model.

### 4. Model Training

Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for emotion recognition.

### 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model on a test set to assess its accuracy and performance.

### 6. Sample Predictions

Generate sample predictions using the trained model and visualize results.

## Results

Provide insights into the performance of the trained model, including accuracy and key observations.
